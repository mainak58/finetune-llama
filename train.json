THOMPSON, Warden, et al.\nNo. A-877 (91-8336).\nMay 20, 1992.\n\nPER CURIAM.\n\n\n1\nAs the District Court below observed, this is now the twelfth round of judicial review in a murder case which began eleven years ago. Yet despite having had eleven years to produce exculpatory evidence, Coleman has produced what, in the words of the District Court, does not even amount to a \"colorable claim of innocence.\" District Court opinion at 19. We are hardly well-positioned to second guess the District Court's factual conclusion\u00e2\u20ac\u201dwe certainly have no basis for concluding that Coleman has produced \"substantial evidence that he may be innocent.\" Post, at 189 (emphasis added). Indeed, a good deal of Coleman's effort in this latest round is devoted to an attempt to undermine an expert's genetic analysis that further implicated him in the crime\u00e2\u20ac\u201dan analysis conducted after trial at Coleman's request under the supervision of the Commonwealth's courts.\n\n\n2\nContrary to the dissent's characterization, Coleman's claim is far from \"substantially identical\" to that of Leonel Herrera, see Herrera v. Collins, --- U.S. ----, 112 S.Ct. 1074, 117 L.Ed.2d 279 (cert. granted, Feb. 19, 1992). In Herrera the District Court concluded that the evidence of innocence warranted further inquiry. See 954 F.2d 1029 (CA5 1992). Here, in contrast, the District Court reviewed Coleman's claim of innocence and rejected it on the merits.\n\n\n3\nThe application for stay of execution presented to the Chief Justice and by him referred to the full Court is denied.\n\n\n4\n\nIt is so ordered.\n\n\n\n5\nJustice STEVENS concurs in the denial of a stay and would deny the petition for writ of certiorari.\n\n\n6\nJustice BLACKMUN, dissenting.\n\n\n7\nLast Term the Court ruled that Roger Coleman could not present his arguments on the merits to the federal courts, simply because the person then acting as his attorney had made a trivial error in filing his notice of appeal three days late. Coleman v. Thompson, 501 U.S. ----, 111 S.Ct. 2546, 115 L.Ed.2d 640 (1991). While I dissented from that ruling\u00e2\u20ac\u201dand still believe it was erroneous\u00e2\u20ac\u201dI found some consolation in the Court's suggestion that matters might have been different had Coleman argued that he was actually innocent of the crime. See id., at 501 U.S., at ---- - ----, ----, 111 S.Ct., at ---- - ----, ----.\n\n\n8\nColeman has now produced substantial evidence that he may be innocent of the crime for which he was sentenced to die. Yet the Court once again turns him away, this time permitting the Commonwealth of Virginia to execute him without a hearing at which his evidence could be fully presented. The Court's ruling is all the more troubling for me, in view of this Court's decision to hear argument next Term in a case in which the petitioner contends, just as Coleman does, that evidence of his innocence entitles him to a hearing on the merits. Herrera v. Collins, --- U.S. ----, 112 S.Ct. 1074, 117 L.Ed.2d 279 (1992).\n\n\n9\nI have previously voted to stay an execution pending this Court's decision next Term in Herrera. See Ellis v. Texas, 503 U.S. ----, 112 S.Ct. 1285, 117 L.Ed.2d 509 (1992); Ellis v. Collins, 503 U.S. ----, 112 S.Ct. 1285, 117 L.Ed.2d 510 (1992). I cannot believe that Coleman, who raises a substantially identical claim, should be denied all possibility of relief simply because his petition reached this Court later than did Leonel Herrera's. Accordingly, I would stay the execution.\n\n\n10\nJustice SOUTER would grant the application for stay of execution.\n\n\nWhat is the issue area being addressed in the opinion?:\n[\"Criminal Procedure\", \"Civil Rights\", \"First Amendment\", \"Due Process\", \"Privacy\", \"Attorneys\", \"Unions\", \"Economic Activity\", \"Judicial Power\", \"Federalism\", \"Interstate Relations\", \"Federal Taxation\", \"Miscellaneous\"]\n\nAnswer:",

It presents, in addition, some risks unique to leafletting. And of course, as with solicitation, these risks must be evaluated against a backdrop of the substantial congestion problem facing the Port Authority and with an eye to the cumulative impact that will result if all groups are permitted terminal access. Viewed in this light, I conclude that the distribution ban, no less than the solicitation ban, is reasonable. I therefore dissent from the Court's holding striking the distribution ban.\n\n\n5\nI will not trouble to repeat in detail all that has been stated in No. 91-155, International Society for Krishna Consciousness, Inc. v. Lee, --- U.S. ----, 112 S.Ct. 2701, --- L.Ed.2d ----, describing the risks and burdens flowing to travelers and the Port Authority from permitting solicitation in airport terminals. Suffice it to say that the risks and burdens posed by leafletting are quite similar to those posed by solicitation. The weary, harried, or hurried traveler may have no less desire and need to avoid the delays generated by having literature foisted upon him than he does to avoid delays from a financial solicitation. And while a busy passenger perhaps may succeed in fending off a leafletter with minimal disruption to himself by agreeing simply to take the proffered material, this does not completely ameliorate the dangers of congestion flowing from such leafletting. Others may choose not simply to accept the material but also to stop and engage the leafletter in debate, obstructing those who follow. Moreover, those who accept material may often simply drop it on the floor once out of the leafletter's range, creating an eyesore, a safety hazard, and additional clean-up work for airport staff. See City Council of Los Angeles v. Taxpayers for Vincent, 466 U.S. 789, 816-817, 104 S.Ct. 2118, 2134-2135, 80 L.Ed.2d 772 (1984) (aesthetic interests may provide basis for restricting speech); Sloane Supplemental Affidavit \u00c2\u00b6 10, App. 514 (noting increased maintenance problems that result from solicitation and distribution).\n\n\n6\nIn addition, a differential ban that permits leafletting but prohibits solicitation, while giving the impression of permitting the Port Authority at least half of what it seeks, may in fact prove for the Port Authority to be a much more Pyrrhic victory. Under the regime that is today sustained, the Port Authority is obliged to permit leafletting. But monitoring leafletting activity in order to ensure that it is only leafletting that occurs, and not also soliciting, may prove little less burdensome than the monitoring that would be required if solicitation were permitted. At a minimum, therefore, I think it remains open whether at some future date the Port Authority may be able to reimpose a complete ban, having developed evidence that enforcement of a differential ban is overly burdensome. Until now it has had no reason or means to do this, since it is only today that such a requirement has been announced.\n\n\n7\nFor the foregoing reasons, and for the reasons stated in the opinion in No. 91-155, 112 S.Ct. 2701, I respectfully dissent.\n\n\"\nThe relevant issue area is::\n[\"Criminal Procedure\", \"Civil Rights\", \"First Amendment\", \"Due Process\", \"Privacy\", \"Attorneys\", \"Unions\", \"Economic Activity\", \"Judicial Power\", \"Federalism\", \"Interstate Relations\", \"Federal Taxation\", \"Miscellaneous\"]\n\nAnswer:",

STORRIE et al.\nNo. 92-6846.\nMarch 8, 1993.\n\nPER CURIAM.\n\n\n1\nPro se petitioner John R. Demos, Jr. has made 48 in forma pauperis filings in this Court since the beginning of the October 1988 Term, many of which challenged sanctions imposed by lower courts for frivolous filings. Almost two years ago, we prospectively denied Demos leave to proceed in forma pauperis \"in all future petitions for extraordinary relief.\" In re Demos, 500 U.S. ----, ----, 111 S.Ct. 1569, 1570, 114 L.Ed.2d 20 (1991) (per curiam ). At that time, we said that Demos \"remains free under the present order to file in forma pauperis requests for relief other than an extraordinary writ, if he qualifies under this Court's Rule 39 and does not similarly abuse that privilege.\" Ibid.\n\n\n2\nSince then, Demos has filed 14 petitions for certiorari. We denied the first seven petitions outright, and denied Demos leave to proceed in forma pauperis under our Rule 39.8 as to the following six. Today, we invoke Rule 39.8 again with respect to the instant petition. Demos is allowed until March 29, 1993, within which to pay the docketing fees required by Rule 38 and to submit the petition in compliance with this Court's Rule 33. Because Demos has refused to heed our prior warning, we further direct the Clerk to reject all future petitions for certiorari from Demos in noncriminal matters unless he pays the docketing fee required by Rule 38 and submits his petition in compliance with Rule 33. See Martin v. District of Columbia Court of Appeals, 506 U.S. ----, 113 S.Ct. 397, 121 L.Ed.2d 305 (1992) (per curiam ). Demos' continued course of abusive filings plainly warrants this sanction.\n\n\n3\n\nIt is so ordered.\n\n\n\n4\nJustice STEVENS, with whom Justice BLACKMUN joins, dissenting.\n\n\n5\nIn my opinion, the administration of special procedures for disposing of repetitive and frivolous petitions is less efficient than our past practice of simply denying such petitions.* I continue to adhere to my previously stated views on this issue, see Martin v.

Accordingly, I respectfully dissent.\n\n\n\n*\n The next issue the Court will confront in developing its Rule 39.8 jurisprudence, for instance, is whether to apply orders like today's retroactively, to petitions pending on the date they are issued.\n\n\n Determine the relevant issue area discussed in the opinion::\n[\"Criminal Procedure\", \"Civil Rights\", \"First Amendment\", \"Due Process\", \"Privacy\", \"Attorneys\", \"Unions\", \"Economic Activity\", \"Judicial Power\", \"Federalism\", \"Interstate Relations\", \"Federal Taxation\", \"Miscellaneous\"]\n\nAnswer:",

This order will free the Court's limited resources to consider the claims of those petitioners who, unlike Day, have not abused the certiorari process.\nMotions denied.\nON MOTION FOR LEAVE TO PROCEED IN FORMA PAUPERIS\nPER CURIAM.\n\n\n1\nPro se petitioner Roy A. Day requests leave to proceed in forma pauperis under Rule 39 of this Court. We deny this request pursuant to Rule 39.8. Day is allowed until November 2, 1993, within which to pay the docketing fees required by Rule 38 and to submit his petitions in compliance with this Court's Rule 33. We also direct the Clerk not to accept any further petitions for certiorari from Day in noncriminal matters unless he pays the docketing fee required by Rule 38 and submits his petition in compliance with Rule 33.\n\n\n2\nDay is an abuser of this Court's certiorari process. We first invoked Rule 39.8 to deny Day in forma pauperis status last June. See In re Day, 509 U. S. 902 (1993). At that time he had filed 27 petitions in the past nine years. Although Day was granted in forma pauperis status to file these petitions, all were denied without recorded dissent. Since we first denied him in forma pauperis status last June, he has filed eight more petitions for certiorari with this Court\u00e2\u20ac\u201dall of them demonstrably frivolous.\n\n\n3\nAs we have recognized, \"[e]very paper filed with the Clerk of this Court, no matter how repetitious or frivolous, requires some portion of the institution's limited resources. A part of the Court's responsibility is to see that these resources are allocated in a way that promotes the interests of justice.\" In re McDonald, 489 U. S. 180, 184 (1989) (per curiam). Consideration of Day's repetitious and frivolous petitions for certiorari does not promote this end.\n\n\n4\nWe have entered orders similar to the present one on previous occasions to prevent pro se petitioners from filing repetitious and frivolous requests for certiorari, see Martin v. District of Columbia Court of Appeals, 506 U. S. 1 (1992) (per curiam), and repetitious and frivolous requests for extraordinary relief. See In re Sindram, 498 U. S. 177 (1991) (per curiam); In re McDonald, supra.\n\n\n5\nDay's refusal to heed our earlier warning requires us to take this step. His abuse of the writ of certiorari has been in noncriminal cases, and so we limit our sanction accordingly. The order therefore will not prevent Day from petitioning to challenge criminal sanctions which might be imposed on him. But it will free this Court's limited resources to consider the claims of those petitioners who have not abused our certiorari process.\n\n\n6\n\nIt is so ordered.\n\n\n\n\nNotes:\n\n\n*\n Together with No. 92-8792,Day v.

The District Court did not make the immunity finding as claimed by the Court of Appeals, and the Court of Appeals overlooked evidence strongly supporting Burden's contention regarding an immunity deal. On remand, the Court of Appeals or, subject to its further order, the District Court must determine whether counsel's representation created an actual conflict of interest adversely affecting his performance.\nCertiorari granted; 975 F. 2d 771, reversed and remanded.\nON PETITION FOR WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE ELEVENTH CIRCUIT\nPER CURIAM.\n\n\n1\nIn Burden v. Zant, 498 U. S. 433 (1991) (per curiam), we reversed a judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit, which had upheld denial of habeas relief on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel due to conflict of interest. The case is before us again on a petition seeking review of the decision rendered on remand, 975 F. 2d 771 (1992), in which the Court of Appeals once again rejected Burden's claim that he had been deprived of the right to be represented by counsel free of conflict of interest.\n\n\n2\nIn our earlier unanimous per curiam opinion, we held that the courts below had failed to accord the presumption of correctness apparently due a state-court determination bearing on the conflict claim (i. e., that Dixon, the key prosecution witness allegedly represented by Burden's pretrial counsel, \"`was granted immunity from prosecution,'\" 498 U. S., at 436). See 28 U. S. C. \u00c2\u00a7 2254(d). We directed the Court of Appeals on remand to evaluate Burden's conflict-of-interest claim \"free from\" the \"erroneous failure to credit the state trial court's finding . . . .\" 498 U. S., at 438.\n\n\n3\nIn the decision now before us, the Eleventh Circuit majority first held that there was no need for a federal habeas court to presume the correctness of the immunity finding, because it had not been \"adequately developed\" in the state trial court proceeding. See 28 U. S. C. \u00c2\u00a7 2254(d)(3). The majority reasoned that the trial court's conclusion, contained in an administrative report to the State Supreme Court, see Ga. Code Ann. \u00c2\u00a7 17-10-35(a) (1990), and not labeled a finding of fact or conclusion of law, amounted to the trial judge's mere personal \"impression\" on an issue not subject to significant dispute at trial. See 975 F. 2d, at 774-775. Declaring it \"improper\" to defer to the judge's \"comment,\" id., at 775, the Court of Appeals explained that it would uphold its prior denial of relief on the basis of a District Court finding, said to be that \"Dixon did not testify under a grant of transactional immunity or pursuant to a promise that the State would not prosecute him,\" ibid. In a dissenting opinion, Judge Anderson maintained that the District Court's order contained no such finding and that his colleagues had overlooked the record of evidence strongly supporting Burden's contention that some sort of immunity deal had, in fact, been struck.\n\n\n4\nReviewing the record, we are convinced that Judge Anderson was correct, that the decision of the Court of Appeals was grounded on manifest mistake, and that reversal is warranted on that basis alone. We therefore grant the motion for leave to proceed in forma pauperis and the petition for a writ of certiorari and reverse and remand for the Eleventh Circuit, or subject to its further order the District Court, to determine whether Mr. Kondritzer's representation created \"an actual conflict of interest adversely affect[ing] [his] performance.\" Cuyler v.

S. 335, 350 (1980).\n\n\n5\n\nReversed and remanded.\n\n\n Determine the relevant issue area discussed in the opinion::\n[\"Criminal Procedure\", \"Civil Rights\", \"First Amendment\", \"Due Process\", \"Privacy\", \"Attorneys\", \"Unions\", \"Economic Activity\", \"Judicial Power\", \"Federalism\", \"Interstate Relations\", \"Federal Taxation\", \"Miscellaneous\"]\n\nAnswer:",

Bertollt, etc.\nNo. 94-197.\nSupreme Court of the United States\nFeb. 22, 1995.\n\nPER CURIAM.\n\n\n1\nUnder Aid to Families With Dependent Children (AFDC), 49 Stat. 627, as amended, 42 U.S.C. \u00c2\u00a7 601 et seq., the Federal Government partially reimburses States for welfare programs that either comply with all federal prescriptions or receive a waiver from the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS). 42 U.S.C. \u00c2\u00a7 1315. California seeks to change its AFDC program by limiting new residents, for the first year they live in California, to the benefits paid in the State from which they came. See Cal.Welf. & Inst.Code Ann. \u00c2\u00a7 11450.03 (West Supp.1994). Green and other new residents who receive AFDC benefits challenged the constitutionality of this California statute in a federal court action; they maintain that the payment differential between new and long-term residents burdens interstate migration and thus violates the right to travel recognized in Shapiro v. Thompson, 394 U.S. 618, 89 S.Ct. 1322, 22 L.Ed.2d 600 (1969), and its progeny. The United States District Court for the Eastern District of California enjoined the payment differential, Green v. Anderson, 811 F.Supp. 516, 523 (1993), and the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed. Green v. Anderson, 26 F.3d 95 (1994). We granted California's petition for certiorari. 513 U.S. ----, 115 S.Ct. 306, 130 L.Ed.2d 218 (1994). We now find, however, that no justiciable controversy is before us, because the case in its current posture is not ripe.\n\n\n2\nThe California statute provides that the payment differential shall not take effect absent receipt by the State of an HHS waiver. See Cal.Welf. & Inst.Code Ann. \u00c2\u00a7 11450.03(b) (West Supp.1994). HHS originally granted a waiver, which was in effect when the District Court and Court of Appeals ruled. But \"ripeness is peculiarly a question of timing,\" and \"it is the situation now rather than the situation at the time of the [decision under review] that must govern.\" Regional Rail Reorganization Act Cases, 419 U.S. 102, 140, 95 S.Ct. 335, 357, 42 L.Ed.2d 320 (1974). After the Court of Appeals ruled in this case, it vacated the HHS waiver in a separate proceeding, concluding that the Secretary had not adequately considered objections to California's program. Beno v. Shalala, 30 F.3d 1057, 1073-1076 (CA9 1994). The Secretary did not seek this Court's review of the Beno decision. California acknowledges that even if it prevails here, the payment differential will not take effect. Tr. of Oral Arg. 3-6. Absent favorable action by HHS on a renewed application for a waiver, California will continue to treat Green and others similarly situated the same way it treats long-term California residents. The parties have no live dispute now, and whether one will arise in the future is conjectural. See Hall v. Beals, 396 U.S. 45, 90 S.Ct. 200, 24 L.Ed.2d 214 (1969) (per curiam ) (after this Court noted probable jurisdiction, Colorado legislature reduced to two months challenged six-month residency requirement for voting in presidential elections; revival of controversy consequently became too speculative to warrant Court's passing on substantive issues).\n\n\n3\nIn view of the impediment to dispositive adjudication, we direct the vacation of prior judgments in this case. As we explained earlier this Term, in deciding whether to disturb prior judgments in a case rendered nonjusticiable, we have inquired, pivotally, \"whether the party seeking relief from the judgment below caused the [nonjusticiability] by voluntary action.\" U.S. Bancorp Mortgage Co. v. Bonner Mall Partnership, 513 U.S. ----, ----, 115 S.Ct. 386, 391, 130 L.Ed.2d 233 (1994). Unlike settlement, see ibid., or a losing party's decision to forgo appeal, see Karcher v. May, 484 U.S. 72, 83, 108 S.Ct. 388, 395, 98 L.Ed.2d 327 (1987), California's loss of the federal approval necessary to implement its program was not voluntary. Vacatur is appropriate, therefore, to \"clea[r] the path for future relitigation of the issues between parties and [to] eliminat[e] a judgment, review of which was prevented through happenstance.\" United States v. Munsingwear, Inc., 340 U.S. 36, 40, 71 S.Ct. 104, 107, 95 L.Ed. 36 (1950).\n\n\n4\nAccordingly, the judgment of the United States Court of Appeals is vacated, and the case is remanded to that court with directions to order the vacation of the District Court's judgment and the dismissal of the case.\n\n\n5\n\nIt is so ordered.\n\n\n\"\nWhat is the central issue area addressed in the opinion?:\n[\"Criminal Procedure\", \"Civil Rights\", \"First Amendment\", \"Due Process\", \"Privacy\", \"Attorneys\", \"Unions\", \"Economic Activity\", \"Judicial Power\", \"Federalism\", \"Interstate Relations\", \"Federal Taxation\", \"Miscellaneous\"]\n\nAnswer:",

WHITAKERv.SUPERIOR COURT OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO COUNTY (MERRILL REESE, INC., Real Party in Interest).\nNo. 94-7743.\nSupreme Court of the United States\nApril 17, 1995.\n\nPER CURIAM.\n\n\n1\nPro se petitioner Fred Whitaker has filed a petition for writ of certiorari and requests leave to proceed in forma pauperis under Rule 39 of this Court. Pursuant to Rule 39.8, we deny petitioner's request to proceed in forma pauperis.* Petitioner is allowed until May 8, 1995, to pay the docketing fees required by Rule 38 and to submit his petition in compliance with this Court's Rule 33. For the reasons explained below, we also direct the Clerk of the Court not to accept any further petitions for certiorari from petitioner in noncriminal matters unless he pays the docketing fees required by Rule 38 and submits his petition in compliance with Rule 33.\n\n\n2\nPetitioner is a prolific filer in this Court. Since 1987, he has filed 24 petitions for relief, including 6 petitions for extraordinary relief and 18 petitions for certiorari. Fifteen of the twenty-four petitions have been filed in the last four Terms, and we have denied all 24 petitions without recorded dissent. We also have denied petitioner leave to proceed in forma pauperis pursuant to Rule 39.8 of this Court for the last three petitions in which he has sought extraordinary relief. See In re Whitaker, 513 U.S. ----, 115 S.Ct. 570, 130 L.Ed.2d 488 (1994); In re Whitaker, 511 U.S. ---, 114 S.Ct. 2098, 128 L.Ed.2d 661 (1994); In re Whitaker, 506 U.S. ----, 113 S.Ct. 489, 121 L.Ed.2d 428 (1992). And earlier this Term, we directed the Clerk of the Court \"not to accept any further petitions for extraordinary writs from petitioner in noncriminal matters unless he pays the docketing fee required by Rule 38(a) and submits his petition in compliance with Rule 33.\" 513 U.S., at ----, 115 S.Ct., at 570. Though we warned petitioner at that time about his \"frequent filing patterns with respect to petitions for writ of certiorari,\" ibid., we limited our sanction to petitions for extraordinary writs.\n\n\n3\nWe now find it necessary to extend that sanction to petitions for certiorari filed by petitioner. In what appears to be an attempt to circumvent this Court's prior order, petitioner has labeled his instant petition a \"petition for writ of certiorari\" even though it would seem to be more aptly termed a \"petition for an extraordinary writ\": he argues that the California Supreme Court erred in denying his petition for review of a California Court of Appeals order which denied his petition for writ of mandate/prohibition seeking to compel a California trial judge to make a particular ruling in a civil action filed by petitioner. And the legal arguments petitioner makes in his instant \"petition for writ of certiorari\" are, just as those made in his previous 18 petitions for certiorari, frivolous. As we told petitioner earlier this Term, \"[t]he goal of fairly dispensing justice . . . is compromised when the Court is forced to devote its limited resources to the processing of repetitious and frivolous requests.\" Ibid. (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).\n\n\n4\nPetitioner's abuse of petitions for certiorari has occurred only in noncriminal cases, and we limit our sanction accordingly. This order therefore will not prevent petitioner from filing a petition for certiorari to challenge criminal sanctions which might be imposed upon him. But like other similar orders we have issued, see In re Sassower, 510 U.S. ----, 114 S.Ct. 2, 126 L.Ed.2d 6 (1993); Day v. Day, 510 U.S. ----, 114 S.Ct. 4, 126 L.Ed.2d 1 (1993); Demos v.

District of Columbia Court of Appeals, 506 U.S. ----, 113 S.Ct. 397, 121 L.Ed.2d 305 (1992), this order will allow the Court to devote its limited resources to the claims of petitioners who have not abused our process.\n\n\n5\n\nIt is so ordered.\n\n\n\n6\nJustice STEVENS, dissenting.\n\n\n7\nA simple denial would adequately serve the laudable goal of conserving the Court's \"limited resources.\" Ante, at ____.

Days, III, Sol. Gen., Jo Ann Harris, Asst. Atty. Gen., Michael R. Dreeben, Acting Deputy Sol. Gen., Miguel A. Estrada, Asst. to the Sol. Gen., Dept. of Justice, Washington, DC, for petitioner.\nGlenn Stewart Warren (Appointed by this Court), San Diego, CA, for respondent.\nPER CURIAM.\n\n\n1\nRespondent, Juan Paul Robertson, was charged with various narcotics offenses, and with violating \u00c2\u00a7 1962(a) of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO), 18 U.S.C. \u00c2\u00a7 1961 et seq. (1988 ed. and Supp. V), by investing the proceeds of those unlawful activities in the \"acquisition of any interest in, or the establishment or operation of, any enterprise which is engaged in, or the activities of which affect, interstate or foreign commerce.\" 18 U.S.C. \u00c2\u00a7 1962(a). He was convicted on some of the narcotics counts, and on the RICO count by reason of his investment in a certain gold mine. The United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed the RICO conviction on the ground that the Government had failed to introduce sufficient evidence proving that the gold mine was \"engaged in or affect[ed] interstate commerce\". 15 F.3d 862, 868 (1994). We granted the United States' petition for certiorari. 513 U.S. ----, 115 S.Ct. 354, 130 L.Ed.2d 309 (1994).\n\n\n2\nThe facts relevant to the \"engaged in or affecting interstate commerce\" issue were as follows: Some time in 1985, Robertson entered into a partnership agreement with another man, whereby he agreed to finance a goldmining operation in Alaska. In fulfillment of this obligation, Robertson, who resided in Arizona, made a cash payment of $125,000 for placer gold mining claims near Fairbanks. He paid approximately $100,000 (in cash) for mining equipment and supplies, some of which were purchased in Los Angeles and transported to Alaska for use in the mine. Robertson also hired and paid the expenses for seven out-of-state employees to travel to Alaska to work in the mine. The partnership dissolved during the first mining season, but Robertson continued to operate the mine through 1987 as a sole proprietorship. He again hired a number of employees from outside Alaska to work in the mine. During its operating life, the mine produced between $200,000 and $290,000 worth of gold, most of which was sold to refiners within Alaska, although Robertson personally transported approximately $30,000 worth of gold out of the State.\n\n\n3\nMost of the parties' arguments, here and in the Ninth Circuit, were addressed to the question whether the activities of the gold mine \"affected\" interstate commerce. We have concluded we do not have to consider that point. The \"affecting commerce\" test was developed in our jurisprudence to define the extent of Congress's power over purely intrastate commercial activities that nonetheless have substantial interstate effects. See, e.g., Wickard v. Filburn, 317 U.S. 111, 63 S.Ct. 82, 87 L.Ed. 122 (1942). The proof at Robertson's trial, however, focused largely on the interstate activities of Robertson's mine. For example, the Government proved that Robertson purchased at least $100,000 worth of equipment and supplies for use in the mine. Contrary to the Court of Appeals' suggestion, all of those items were not purchased locally (\"drawn generally from the stream of interstate commerce,\" 15 F.3d, at 869 (internal quotation marks omitted)); the Government proved that some of them were purchased in California and transported to Alaska for use in the mine's operations. Cf. United States v. American Building Maintenance Industries, 422 U.S. 271, 285, 95 S.Ct. 2150, 2159, 45 L.Ed.2d 177 (1975) (allegation that company had made local purchases of equipment and supplies that were merely manufactured out of state was insufficient to show that company was \"engaged in commerce\" within the meaning of \u00c2\u00a7 7 of the Clayton Act). The Government also proved that, on more than one occasion, Robertson sought workers from out of state and brought them to Alaska to work in the mine. Cf. id., at 274, 95 S.Ct., at 2153. Furthermore, Robertson, the mine's sole proprietor, took $30,000 worth of gold, or 15% of the mine's total output, with him out of the State.\n\n\n4\nWhether or not these activities met (and whether or not, to bring the gold mine within the \"affecting commerce\" provision of RICO, they would have to meet) the requirement of substantially affecting interstate commerce, they assuredly brought the gold mine within \u00c2\u00a7 1962(a)'s alternative criterion of \"any enterprise . . . engaged in . . . interstate or foreign commerce.\" As we said in American Building Maintenance, a corporation is generally \"engaged 'in commerce' \" when it is itself \"directly engaged in the production, distribution, or acquisition of goods and services in interstate commerce.\" Id., at 283, 95 S.Ct., at 2158.

NETHERLAND, Wardenv.Lem Davis TUGGLE.No. A-209.\nSupreme Court of the United States\nSept. 14, 1995.\n\nPER CURIAM.\n\n\n1\nApplicant asks that we vacate a stay of execution granted Tuggle by the Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit. Because we agree with applicant that the stay was improvidently entered, we grant his application to vacate, provided that the stay shall remain in effect until September 20, 1995, to allow Tuggle's counsel opportunity to seek a further stay in this Court.\n\n\n2\nOn June 29, 1995, the Court of Appeals issued an opinion vacating the District Court's grant of habeas relief, finding all of Tuggle's constitutional claims to be without merit. Tuggle v. Thompson, 57 F.3d 1356. The court stayed the issuance of its mandate on August 2, however, and granted Tuggle a 30-day stay of execution pending t he filing of a timely petition for certiorari in this Court; then on August 25 it extended the stay of execution for the full 90 days allowed to file a certiorari petition in this Court.\n\n\n3\nBoth actions of the court were taken by summary order without opinion or discussion. Nothing indicates that the Court of Appeals even attempted to undertake the three-part inquiry required by our decision in Barefoot v. Estelle, 463 U.S. 880, 895-896, 103 S.Ct. 3383, 3395-3396, 77 L.Ed.2d 1090 (1983). See also Maggio v. Williams, 464 U.S. 46, 48, 104 S.Ct. 311, 312, 78 L.Ed.2d 43 (1983) (per curiam ); Autry v. Estelle, 464 U.S. 1, 2-3, 104 S.Ct. 20, 21-22, 78 L.Ed.2d 1 (1983) (per curiam ). There is no hint that the court found that \"four Members of th[is] Court would consider the underlying issue sufficiently meritorious for the grant of certiorari\" or that \"a significant possibility of reversal\" existed. Barefoot, supra, at 895, 103 S.Ct., at 3395. We think the inescapable conclusion is that the Court of Appeals mistakenly believed that a capital defendant as a matter of right was entitled to a stay of execution until he has filed a petition for certiorari in due course. But this view was rejected in Autry, supra, at 2, 104 S.Ct., at 21, and Maggio, supra, at 48, 104 S.Ct., at 312.\n\n\n4\nAccordingly, the application to vacate the stay of execution is granted.\n\n\n5\nJustice STEVENS, with whom Justice GINSBURG joins, dissenting.\n\n\n6\nBecause there is no support in the record for the conclusion that the Court of Appeals abused its discretion when it granted a stay of execution to enable respondent Tuggle to file a petition for certiorari, I respectfully dissent. The fact that the respondent has substantial grounds for challenging the constitutionality of his death sentence is demonstrated both by the issuance of a writ of habeas corpus by the District Court and by the 19-page opinion filed by the Court of Appeals. Tuggle v. Thompson, 57 F.3d 1356 (CA4 1995). Promptly after that opinion was announced, respondent filed a motion for a stay of execution supported by an explanation of why \"the three-part inquiry,\" ante, at __, described in Barefoot v.

We also direct the Clerk not to accept any further petitions for certiorari from Attwood in noncriminal matters unless he pays the docketing fee required by Rule 38 and submits his petition in compliance with Rule 33.\n\n\n2\nAttwood has abused this Court's certiorari process. In November 1995, we twice invoked Rule 39.8 to deny Attwood in forma pauperis status. See Attwood v. Smith and Attwood v. Palm Beach Post, 516 U.S. ----, 116 S.Ct. 416, 133 L.Ed.2d 334.

Attwood's abuse of the writ of certiorari has been in noncriminal cases, and so we limit our sanction accordingly.
